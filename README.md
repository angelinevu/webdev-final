# Intro To Web Development Final

To run this project, simply open the main.html file in your web browser.

This project uses EmailJS to send emails. The EmailJS client requires an SDK key, service ID, and template ID. This code already includes these values associated with my account, so you do not need to create your own. But if you prefer, you can visit https://www.emailjs.com/ to create your own service and template, then update the project with your own SDK key, service ID, and template ID.
